### Before you go

1) Get the full set of flight numbers for the entire itinerary.

Example: TPE‑SEA‑RDU → need both segments:
* TPE‑SEA: DL68
* SEA‑RDU: DL489

Do not only track the first or last segment — you may miss delays.

2) Install and track with Flightradar24 and FlightAware:

### Day‑of checks

1) Verify flight status (delays, equipment changes, weather disruptions).
2) Check airport status on FAA NAS: https://nasstatus.faa.gov/
