# Car Purchase Guide

New cars
--------

Tip: Do not visit the dealer before you have a written quote.

Use a fresh email for car‑related communication (dealers and insurers send lots of marketing). Proton Mail is a good option: https://proton.me/mail

Search inventory within ~50 miles for the model/trim you want.

Window Sticker (Monroney)
-------------------------

The Window Sticker is required by law and lists MSRP, destination, options, and add‑ons.

* Good: MSRP + Destination only; no dealer add‑ons.
* Acceptable: A few useful add‑ons (e.g., all‑weather mats, cargo tray).
* Bad: Lots of overpriced dealer/distributor add‑ons (paint protection, screen protectors, cables, mudguards, etc.).

Common line items:
* MSRP / Adjusted Price (after discounts)

Insurance
---------

See [Auto Insurance](transport/auto-insurance.md). You can buy insurance online once price and VIN are confirmed.

At the dealership
-----------------

In Finance, decline add‑on packages (extended warranty, paint/tire protection, etc.) unless you specifically want them. Goal: pay the OTD price and leave.
