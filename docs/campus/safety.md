This page summarizes an official message to the Carolina community about reporting crime, Alert Carolina, and safety resources.

Alert Carolina
--------------

UNC–Chapel Hill uses Alert Carolina to notify students, faculty, staff, and visitors about emergencies, dangerous situations, Clery crimes, and impactful weather. Register your cellphone to receive text alerts and check status updates on alertcarolina.unc.edu. Operating status changes are also sent by email.
