# Auto Insurance

Important: Avoid “aggregate quoting” sites. Get quotes directly from insurers.

Minimum rules
-------------

### A. Carry at least 100/300/100 limits

Forget state minimums. Aim for at least:

* Bodily Injury: 100/300 ($100,000 each person, $300,000 each accident)
* Property Damage Liability (PDL): $100,000 each accident

### B. Re‑quote every 6 months

Auto‑renewals often creep up. Shop around before each renewal.

Coverage types (what they do)
-----------------------------

| Coverage | What it covers | Who it covers | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Liability | Injury/property you’re legally responsible for | You/household/any permitted driver | Yes — state minimums apply |
| Collision | Damage to your car from a crash | Your insured or a non‑owned car | No — lenders may require |
| Comprehensive | Non‑collision damage (theft, fire, weather, animal strike, glass) | Your insured or a non‑owned car | No — lenders may require |
| Medical Payments | Necessary medical/funeral expenses | You/household/passengers | No |
| Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist | Injuries and (sometimes) property damage from drivers with no/insufficient insurance | You/household/passengers | Yes — UM required; UIM with higher liability limits |

Do I need Comp/Collision?
-------------------------

Even with an older car, Comprehensive can make sense.

Ask yourself:

1. Could I absorb a total loss without financial strain?
2. Could I replace the car immediately without hardship?

Rule of thumb: If annual Comprehensive premium is less than ~1/20 of the car’s value, keep it.

Why 100/300/100?
----------------

State minimums (e.g., 50/100/50) are often inadequate for real‑world accidents. Higher limits protect you if you injure others — and protect you from underinsured drivers when paired with UM/UIM.

Umbrella insurance
------------------

An umbrella policy can extend liability beyond auto and renters limits. ~$200/year for $1M is common. Often requires base auto limits like 250/500/100 and renters liability around $300k.
