# Money Transfer

Wire

Bank wires for larger transfers; fees and timing vary by bank (domestic vs. international).

Zelle

Most banking apps support Zelle. Common for person‑to‑person transfers. Settlement may take 1–3 days depending on account; transfers are not reversible. Always verify the recipient’s name matches.

ACH

Used for pulls/pushes between accounts and payroll deposits. Slower but low cost.

Direct Deposit
--------------

Set up through your employer or assistantship. You’ll need routing and account numbers.

Checks

Still used for some payments (e.g., rent, deposits). Mobile deposit is widely available.
